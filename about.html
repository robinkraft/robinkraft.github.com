---

I enjoy data and making maps and product. I've built things no one wants enough that I try not to do that anymore. Things I've built that people care a lot about include [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org) and a [satellite map of last year's wildfires](https://robinkraft.github.io/norcal-fires-imagery/compare.html) in Northern California.

I currently work as a product manager at [Domino Data Lab](https://www.dominodatalab.com). You can learn more about what I'm been up to via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robinkraft) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinkraft).
