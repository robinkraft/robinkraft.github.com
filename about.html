I enjoy data and making maps and product. Things I've built that people care a lot about include <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org">Global Forest Watch</a> and a <a href="https://robinkraft.github.io/norcal-fires-imagery/compare.html">satellite map of last year's wildfires</a> in Northern California.

I currently work as a product manager at <a href="https://www.dominodatalab.com">Domino Data Lab</a>. You can learn more about what I'm been up to via <a href="https://twitter.com/robinkraft">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinkraft">LinkedIn</a>.
