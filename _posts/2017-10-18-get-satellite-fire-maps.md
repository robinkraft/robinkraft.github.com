Wrapping up: Get your satellite fire map here!
==============================

The last week has been intense with all the interest in satellite mapping of the Northern California firestorm. And I've updated the imagery in the map a few times, prioritizing recency, sometimes at the expense of visual clarity (curse you Smoke!). I've tried to strike a decent balance.

Red = veg

Pease remember that red in the false color images shows vegetation, NOT fires. A lot of people have misinterpreted this and gotten needlessly worried. Not surprising given all the stress we've been under. but I don't want to add to it!
